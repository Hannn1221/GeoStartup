# Measuring Global Wellbeing: Life Expectancy, Income, and PM2.5  
*Data + ML Portfolio — Statistical Development Analysis*

## Overview  
This project analyses global wellbeing using three indicators: life expectancy, income per capita, and PM2.5 pollution. The goal was to uncover relationships across development and environmental quality.

## What I Did  
- Cleaned and merged cross-country datasets.  
- Generated summary statistics and correlation matrices.  
- Visualized relationships between wellbeing variables.  
- Interpreted structural patterns such as diminishing income returns.

## How I Did It  
Using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`, I produced descriptive summaries and plotted cross-country relationships. Countries were grouped into development categories for clearer interpretation.

## Why It Matters  
Wellbeing is multi-dimensional. This project demonstrates how income, health, and environment interact — a common theme in global development analytics.
